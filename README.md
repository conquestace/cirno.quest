## Build your own Cirno Quest
```bash
git clone https://github.com/conquestace/cirno.quest
cd cirno.quest
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the local server and open the website in your default web browser. By default, it should be available at `http://localhost:3000`
If you'd like to build the production version of the site (optimized and ready for deployment), you can run the following command:`npm run build` instead of `npm start`

This will create a `dist` folder in the project directory containing the website.
